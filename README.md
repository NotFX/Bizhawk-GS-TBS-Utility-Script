# Bizhawk-GS-TBS-Utility-Scripts
The scripts we've gotten used to on VBA, but for Bizhawk's mGBA core instead.

Note: V1.3 and up is written for Bizhawk 2.9;
      V1.2 is for Bizhawk 2.6


How to use: 

1)Load Bizhawk

2)Load mGBA core [does not apply to newer versions of Bizhawk]

3)Load GS:TBS

4)Open LUA console

5)Load utility script

6)Follow console instructions

Supported plugins can be placed in the same directory as the main script and will be detected automatically.
