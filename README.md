# Bizhawk-GS-TBS-Utility-Scripts
The scripts we've gotten used to on VBA, but for Bizhawk's mGBA core instead.

Note: V1.3 and up is written for Bizhawk 2.9;
      V1.2 is for Bizhawk 2.6


How to use: 

1)Load Bizhawk

2)Load GS:TBS

3)Open LUA console

4)Load utility script

5)Follow console instructions

Supported plugins can be placed in the same directory as the main script and will be detected automatically.
